## Application Description
This is a mood tracker that has a form with a text field, switch, radio list, and dropdown. The information can be saved and reset using buttons. In addition, mood entries can be saved and deleted in a list in another page.

## Things you did in your code
I did the additional requirements to the previous exercise by applying the concepts done in the laboratory and present in the handout. 

## Challenges when developing the application
When I implemented the case where clicking the “Save” button twice should not add 2 copies of the mood entry inside the list, I had some difficulty in comparing the duplicate saves to the first one. I couldn't compare the duplicate object to the first object because apparently, I have to compare each attribute manually.
